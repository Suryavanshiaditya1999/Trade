# UNDERSTANDING OF MARKET


### RULE:1 DON"T USE INDICATORS : THEY ARE FRAUD , MARKET MOVES BASED ON ORDER BOOK NOT ON INDICATORS


*In order to understand the market you need to understand that market makers/whales never enters market without liquidity , and their liquidity is your stop loss .. So always , always understand market from their perspective where liquidity resides , how to play on support and resistance. Because most of the traders put their stop loss just below resistance or support and that is the area they hit in order to attack your liquidity .. WHY MARKET MAKERS/WHALES do this you can understand more thoroughly [here](https://github.com/Suryavanshiaditya1999/Trade/blob/main/F%26O/whales.md)*


### RULE2: BE PATIENT .. NEVER TAKE TRADE IN CONSOLIDATED MARKET , LOOK FOR MOMENTUM AND TAKE TRADE WITH TREND
